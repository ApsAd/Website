This faculty development programme is intended to provide opportunity for teachers employed in AICTE approved institutions for teaching and upgrading their knowledge in the area of Design and Analysis of Algorithms. This programme will be very useful for those who are involved in teaching the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms at U.G level.

The objective of this programme is to provide an understanding of the fundamentals and a comprehensive knowledge in the field of Computer Algorithms. At the end of FDP, your knowledge of algorithm design, latest practices and problem solving techniques will be refreshed. The approach demonstrated will draw your students to take interest in algorithmic problem solving and help you prepare them for facing placement interviews. Participants will get a certificate jointly from SSN and ACM.
